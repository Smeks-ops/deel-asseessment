# DEEL BACKEND TASK - Node.js/Express.js REST API

Welcome to the Deel Backend Task! This README provides an overview of the Node.js/Express.js application you'll be working with. The application serves as a REST API for managing contracts and jobs between clients and contractors.

## Project Overview
The project consists of a Node.js/Express.js application interfacing with a SQLite database using Sequelize ORM. It implements various APIs for handling profiles, contracts, and jobs within a freelance platform context.

## Data Models
- Profile: Represents a user who can be either a client or a contractor.
- Contract: Represents a contract between a client and a contractor.
- Job: Represents a job that a contractor performs for a client under a contract.

## Key Features
- Authentication of users and access control for contracts.
- API endpoints for managing contracts, jobs, and user balances.
- Transactional handling for financial operations.
- Concurrency control for simultaneous requests.

## Technical Stack 
- Runtime: Node.js
-Framework: Express.js
- Database: SQLite
- ORM: Sequelize

# API Documentation
The API documentation, including detailed endpoint descriptions, request/response structures, and usage examples, is provided in an exported Postman JSON file located in the root folder of the project.

## Endpoints Implemented
1. GET /contracts/:id: Fetch a specific contract by its ID.
2. GET /contracts: List non-terminated contracts for the authenticated user.
3. GET /jobs/unpaid: Retrieve all unpaid jobs for active contracts of the authenticated user.
4. POST /jobs/:job_id/pay: Pay for a job, transferring funds from a client to a contractor.
5. POST /balances/deposit/:userId: Deposit funds into a client's balance.
6. GET /admin/best-profession: Find the highest-earning profession in a given time range.
7. GET /admin/best-clients: List top-paying clients in a specified period.

# Technical Considerations

## Transactions
- The application uses Sequelize transactions to ensure that financial operations are atomic and consistent. For example, when a client pays for a job, the transaction ensures that the job is marked as paid only if the payment is successful.
  
## Concurrency Control
- Concurrency control is handled to manage simultaneous database operations, ensuring data integrity and consistency. For example, when a client pays for a job, the job is marked as paid only if it is not already paid.

## Code Style and Structure
- The codebase follows standard Node.js/Express.js patterns and practices.
- Models, routes, controllers, and services are organized into separate directories for modularity and maintainability.

# Future Improvements
Given more time and resources, I would have loved to include the following features and improvements as further proof of my experience and skills:
- Add unit tests for the application.
- Add API documentation using Swagger.
- Advanced Authentication and Authorization: Implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for more robust user authentication and role-based access control.
- Microservices Architecture: Refactoring the application into microservices for better scalability, maintainability, and deployment.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.
- Performance Optimization: Implementing caching mechanisms (like Redis) and optimizing database queries for improved performance.
